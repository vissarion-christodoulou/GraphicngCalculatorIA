For technical reasons, a single jar file that runs on any
computer regardless of its jdk and installed libraries could
not be created.

To run the program the BlueJ IDE should be installed on the 
computer, the files in libraries.zip should be extracted and 
the libraries mentioned in the development document, contained 
in this zip, should be added to Tools->Preferences->Libraries
of BlueJ.
Then, the BlueJ package should be run and the javafx thread 
should be called from class Main.
